# Earthquake Analysis Project

This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the global impact of earthquakes, focusing on identifying regions that are most susceptible to seismic activity and the resulting consequences. By leveraging historical data and advanced modeling techniques, the project aims to provide actionable insights and tailored recommendations for countries that are frequently impacted by earthquakes. These suggestions will be geared toward enhancing disaster preparedness, improving infrastructure resilience, and minimizing the socio-economic damage caused by such natural disasters.

In addition to the primary analysis, the project delves into the potential relationship between nuclear power plants and seismic activity. It explores how the presence of these facilities might influence or be influenced by earthquakes, assessing both the risks and the safety measures currently in place. Based on the findings, the project will propose strategic recommendations for the management and operation of nuclear power plants in seismically active regions, ensuring that they can withstand potential earthquake events without compromising public safety or environmental integrity.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the necessary libraries.

## Data Description

Dataset is obtained from the USGS Earthquake website (https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/), covering global earthquake data from 2000 to 2023. With 321,789 observations, 22 variables including time, location, depth, magnitude, and event type. The variables in the dataset and their descriptions are described in the notebook


## Preprocessing 

Only earthquakes from year 2000 to 2023, other preprocessing techniques can be seen in the notebook
